    <h3>Recipe for Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>The following recipe will describe how to make delicious spaghetti.<br>
        I love to make spaghetti because it is easy to make a lot of it. <br>
        Sometimes I even like to add meatballs to it, or horse meat.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti Pasta (From Italy if possible)</li>
        <li>Water (Cannot be in Africa for this)</li>
        <li>A big metal pot</li>
        <li>Pasta Sauce (Has tomatoes)</li>
        <li>Salt (League player tears)</li>
        <li>Meat if applicable (Ground beef or horse meat)</li>
        <li>Strainer for the pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to make this dish: </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the big metal pot and fill it with water.</li>
        <li>Put the pot on the stove and heat it until it boils.</li>
        <li>Place your pasta in the boiling water and salt. <br>
            The salt is so that the pasta does not stick together like conjoined twins.
        </li>
        <li>Boil the pasta until it is al dental. <br>
            This means that the pasta will be soft but not too soft and watery.
        </li>
        <li>Strain the pasta and put it back in the pot.</li>
        <li>Mix the pasta and pasta sauce into one big blob.</li>
        <li>Now you may add your cooked meat or meat balls to the pasta if need be.</li>
